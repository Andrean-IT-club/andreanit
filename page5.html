                <br> - A piril in the virtual world</h2>

                <p class="quote">he Impact of Online Identity Theft on Consumers and Organizations Internet fraud has become a major issue due to the ever increasing population of internet users, because the internet is such an easy solution to fast sufficient services readily available for busy lives that’s why most of us are now dependant on the internet in some shape or form and each time we use the internet we input data that are related to use from our name, address and even bank details with the assurance that the site is safe and trustworthy, but this is not always the case because the security system implemented like all things in this world has weaknesses.
                    <br> 
                </p>
                <p>  
                Online hackers uses programs to penetrate these weaknesses of database system which holds valuable consumer information and data, which they can use for to carry out fraudulent activities such as; credit card scams using stolen identities acquired through the system, or open numerous bank accounts to make overdraft withdrawal using addresses they acquire from the database they’ve hacked. The main areas that online criminals target are bank details and financial records of customers from various organisations that they can get hold of large sums of money so it is worth the risk of hacking. Credit card fraud scheme is when you use your card to shop online, giving details of your account in order to make a purchase, from here if you are careful you can stumble upon a mimicked site that is monitored by fraudsters using a program to record the details entered and these details is then use to make transactions from the victims account into the another account of the criminal or used for purchasing items instead of gaining hard cash, Phishing is a scheme used by fraudsters to ensure online customers to fake websites so they can reveal their bank details either through a purchase or through asking them to verify their account to make sure that the accounts is still active, this had lead to 55% rise in losses from online fraud against banks totally round about 23 millions for the first half of 2006. </p>
                <p>chip and pin was introduced in 2004 in the hope to combat credit card fraud, and did decreased by 13% by the end of 2005, but even with this method in place the percentage of bank losing money from fraud carried out over the telephone, online or mail order rose by 5% and fraud using duplicate or counterfeit cards rose by 16%, this is due to the fact that criminals have access to tools and knowledge to the details of individual magnetic stripes behind a card and the card is then used in places where technology is less high-tech or used abroad because it is hard to detect that the card is being used illegally. Another case of identity theft comes from a Swedish bank Nordea where the bank is unknowingly scammed out of around $1.1 mil through a 3 month time period from customer’s account, of those who had used the internet to access their account and was targeted by the fraudsters using malicious programs to obtain personal login details and then used these details to withdraw. The attackers use the program called Trojan to work over the system like nothing is going on, it then downloads, but the victim is first asked by an automated email sent to them saying that the attach file is an anti-spy ware or anti-spam ware, the Trojan works like a listen for vital details and site that the user visits and records the path that the user takes, after having recorded these information the Trojan then alerts the user that there is something wrong with the page and ask the user to resend the information again, with as little as 2 codes the criminal can access an account to withdraw or make a transfers from one account to another. Due to this big scam the bank had to close down its online operation in 2005 because the system was penetrated once. From these facts we can see that the more user there are the more the bigger the problem with fraud and identity theft becomes, because more users means more data, meaning more for fraudsters to access and steal, from when online shopping was new consumers had an open mind to the new shopping system and was willing to explore with caution, but as this system became more readily available it became easier for criminal to break into these systems through the weak spots. As the problem with identity theft and scams becomes widespread companies beginning to wise up, but by this time it is too late because most customers have lost trust in their security system, especially those small companies, as for the larger companies they implement more expensive security system in the hope to prevent any further attack .</p>
                <br> Consumers and organisations both suffer a big lost in trust, and on the financial side of things it is fair to say the business suffer a greater lost once their system is penetrated by a fraudster, thus companies who can afford to implement more secure systems for their online sites, they can survive as for small business some would suffer bankruptcy and eventually lead to shutting down the business. The strategy that an organisation should adopt in order to prevent attacks to their database systems includes hiring third party security firms to monitor their systems daily routine transactions and implement more trusted software as an aid to boost the security level. Online customers must also take precautions when visiting any websites that they intent on give data about them self by using have anti-spy wear or virus software to safeguard any programs trying to gather their information.
