                        In Order to ease up life on computer and save time and energy, there are certain applications that are required which
                        help us to do the above. In order to use those applications, they can be freeware or payware depending upon its
                        amount of popularity and usage. A freeware product is a product or an application that is made with open mind and
                        one thinking that it should be free to use and not be costing any currency anywhere around the world for that product.
                        A payware product is a product or application that is made to be bought via currency and used under a certain
                        Agreement or License. The Agreement or License adds a restrictive use to the product. It is not compulsory that the
                        licensed software is supposed to be payware, but most of the time it is payware. Here we will consider it as a payware
                        software.

            Let’s Get Down To The Story<br>
                        The Gaming world in the 21st Century is highly sophisticated. It is so deep that if you select any certain computer
                        game you will fall very deep into the amount of realism and hardwork that people do. In order to understand how the
                        freeware and payware system works let’s have a look at a selective game and see how detailed things get. So get ready
                        for an adventure!<br><br>
                        Microsoft Flight Simulator
       <br> 
        </p>
        <p>

            Started 34 years ago in 1982, Microsoft Flight Simulator (MSFS) is till date one of the oldest, educational and most
                        played game in the computer age. The basic concept of the game is to provide the user a feel of flight, what it takes to
                        fly a plane, something that everyone has wanted to do at least once in its lifetime. From small propeller planes to the
                        largest sophisticated commercial airliners till the fastest military jets in the world, all types of aircraft are available
                        on the MSFS Interface. But not only aircrafts is your option, you can choose to fly from Point A to Point B from
                        25,000 airports around the world in any selected time, at any selected weather. With over 15 Versions of the game in
                        the past 34 years, Microsoft Flight Simulator X (FSX) is the latest and the last edition Microsoft ever released and
                        stopped the production in 2009, thus ending the MSFS-Era. But it didn’t stop there.
                        Flight Simulator fans were already very serious with the game, but due to Military Secrets, Government
                        Records and Aviation Secrets, Microsoft never fully opened up the concept of flight to the public, so realism was never
                        achieved 100%. In order to increase it to 100%, third party companies provided Add-ons (Additional Features) to the
                        game for the concept “As Real As It Gets”. Here comes the topic of Payware and Freeware.
                        First came out freeware aircrafts that increased the feeling of flying a real aircraft. But again they just
                        touched the 90% part. So very detailed aircraft came out touching the 100% as we entered the 21st Century.
                        Freeware Products
        </p>

        <p>One of the most famous freeware product on the MSFS Platform was provided by an American-Japanese Company
            called Project Opensky (Posky). People at Posky were very serious. All of them were above the age of 35-40 and
            happily married something people don’t find in gamers. They were so serious about testing their products, that they
            released 7 of them with more than 20 updates and testing 350 hours on each of the products. When they launched it
            they announced it will be freeware forever and that it can be used for all purposes, but only cannot be uploaded
            
            without their copyright. In other words, it may be used without payment but may usually not be modified, re-
            distributed or reverse-engineered without the author's permission. Warren C. Daniel and Hiroshi Igami were the main
            
            two people behind posky. But due to certain limitations, Posky did not have any 100% real data about aircrafts. Even
            the modeling was not quiet upto real. So as every product has its downfall, this product too had one. Without a doubt,
            the Project Opensky team have some real gems here. These are the best freeware aircraft available.</p>
    <p>

        Licensed Software/Payware Products
                        Payware products on MSFS Platform gradually increased once passing the year 2013 as we had an advancement in
                        the technology. More and more people got near to the concept of C programming, HTML, Java Script, due to the
                        online schools. So one of the most famous payware products on the MSFS Platform was provided by a group of people
                        from Canada, Belgium, Germany, Greece, Russia, South Africa and the United States, called the Precision Manuals
                        and Development Group (PMDG) founded by real world pilot Captain Robert S. Randazzo, and when they started,
                        they changed the history of Flight Simulator. They created such detailed aircraft add-ons for the MSFS that it caught
                        the attention of the biggest Aerospace Giant, “The Boeing Company” and the most respected Military Company,
                        “Lockheed Martin”. PMDG requested Boeing to give crucial and inside information about their aircrafts, and thus
                        PMDG and Boeing joined together and changed the history of MSFS. Since Boeing gave crucial information about its
                        aircraft to PMDG, PMDG made the most detailed versions of aircrafts for MSFS. Now since there was crucial
                        information involved, an End-User License Agreement or EULA is signed when you buy the product. EULA is a legal
                        contract between a software application author or publisher and the user of that application. Some copyright owners
                        use EULAs in an effort to circumvent limitations the applicable copyright law places on their copyrights (such as the
                        limitations in sections 107–122 of the United States Copyright Act), or to expand the scope of control over the work
                        into areas for which copyright protection is denied by law (such as attempting to charge for, regulate or prevent
                        private performances of a work beyond a certain number of performances or beyond a certain period of time). Such
                        EULAs are, in essence, efforts to gain control, by contract, over matters upon which copyright law precludes control.
                        This kind of EULAs concurs in aim with DRM and both may be used as alternate methods for widening control over
                        software
    </p>
        <p>The Thesis<br><br>
            Freeware products can be used however you want it to be used, But licensed products have a certain limitation. If the
            product is tampered with or used with any other purposes, it can cause Jail terms with high fines. In the United States,
            Section 117 of the Copyright Act gives the owner of a particular copy of software the explicit right to use the software
            with a computer, even if use of the software with a computer requires the making of incidental copies or adaptations
            (acts which could otherwise potentially constitute copyright infringement). In addition to granting rights and imposing
            restrictions on the use of copyrighted software, software licenses typically contain provisions which allocate liability
            and responsibility between the parties entering into the license agreement. In enterprise and commercial software
            transactions these terms often include limitations of liability, warranties and warranty disclaimers, and indemnity if
            the software infringes intellectual property rights of others.
            Conclusion<br><br>
            So the basic difference between a freeware and license product is that a license products goes into much detail and
            restrictions to use. But the freeware products are more widely and easily available than the payware products. As
            usual, everything has its ups and downs, not all fingers are of the same size, different people have different views. As
            per my view I like freeware more, as it is simple and easy to use and find. Freeware cannot economically rely on
            commercial promotion. I hope you have enjoyed this adventure into the unknown and hope I have made a clear
            comparison between a Freeware and Licensed Product.      </p>
